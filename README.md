My solutions to the Advent of Code 2023 puzzles.

First learned of the event 10 days in, then spent the next 2 weeks trying to catch up. At least I finally caught up before the last day :).
Some solutions are pretty cool, others are terribly bodged together. But hey that's part of the fun.
Maybe I'll try to compete for leaderboards next year...
